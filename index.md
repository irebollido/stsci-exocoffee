## STScI's Exoplanet Journal Club

Welcome to the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) Exoplanetary Journal Club webpage --- also known as STScI's "Exocoffee" ☕!


### ⚫ &nbsp; What is this "Exocoffee"?

STScI's Exocoffee is a classical academic journal club: we meet and discuss (typically recent) papers relevant to exoplanetary science in our sessions. Most of them will probably come from academic journals or the [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/list/astro-ph.EP/recent), but pre-prints in other places or submitted articles are also welcome!

### ⚫ &nbsp; Who can join the Exocoffee?

Everyone is invited to join our sessions, in particular STScI folks and the John Hopkins University (JHU) community, as long as you have an interest in exoplanetary science.

### ⚫ &nbsp; When? Where?

STScI's Exocoffee happens **every other Monday at 9 AM**. Given STScI is under a work from home situation, our meetings are happening **virtually during 2021**. Contact [the organizers](mailto:nespinoza@stsci.edu) for the meeting link, or check the link on the #exocoffee Slack channel in the STScI workspace.
