## STScI's Exoplanet Journal Club

Welcome to the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) Exoplanetary Journal Club webpage --- also known as STScI's "Exocoffee" ☕!

### ⚫ &nbsp; Recent news

- **[March 28, 2022]** We're changing the Exocoffee schedule from Monday's at 9 AM to Tuesdays at 3 PM. *Our last Monday 9 AM session will be on April 4th* (see below for the menu). Then, *our first Tuesday 3 PM session will happen on April 19th*. After this, given the week of May 3rd is Exoplanets IV, we *will be offsetting the exocoffee week to May 10th, and do every other week after that* (i.e., session following to that will be May 24th).

- **[March 28, 2022]** We will be cancelling May 3rd's session and moving it to the next week due to Exoplanets IV.



### ⚫ &nbsp; What is this "Exocoffee"?

STScI's Exocoffee is a classical academic journal club: we meet and discuss (typically recent) papers relevant to exoplanetary science in our sessions. Most of them will probably come from academic journals or the [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/list/astro-ph.EP/recent), but pre-prints in other places or submitted articles are also welcome! Anyone can volunteer to present a paper in the journal club.

**The Exocoffee in 2022 is being co-organized by [Nestor Espinoza](http://nestor-espinoza.com/) and [Isabel Rebollido](https://www.stsci.edu/stsci-research/research-directory/isabel-rebollido)**.

### ⚫ &nbsp; Who can join the Exocoffee?

Everyone is invited to join our sessions, in particular STScI folks and the John Hopkins University (JHU) community, as long as you have an interest in exoplanetary science.

### ⚫ &nbsp; When? Where?

STScI's Exocoffee happens **every other Tuesday at 3 PM**. Given STScI is under a work from home situation, our meetings are happening **virtually during 2022** (with a possibility of hybrid meetings in the summer). Contact the organizers (see above) for the meeting link, or check the link on the #exocoffee Slack channel in the STScI workspace if you are part of it.

### ⚫ &nbsp; Guidelines for presenters

First of all, if you will be a presenter on an upcoming sesion: **thank you very much**! We really appreciate it. Here are some guidelines to follow for the upcoming session:

1. **The session is informal.** This basically means: no slides! Just be prepared to explain the paper to our colleagues and, if you can, feel free to question as much as you can from it so we can spark discussion. Note that going through the paper directly has the added benefit of sharing with the crowd (especially junior folks) what papers on your particular science topic typically look like. Hence, why the "please don't bring slides" policy.

2. **Be mindful of the different backgrounds.** While everyone is interested in exoplanets, there are colleagues working in other areas in the audience which might not have the same knowledge you have on the subject. Explaining non-standard concepts thus is very important! 

3. **The moderator is _typically_ in charge of showing the paper on their end.** The presenter's job is then to guide them through equations and/or figures. If for some reason you would like to share the paper on your end as the presenter, that is of course fine --- let the moderator know before the start of the session.

4. **Each paper is typically discussed by about 25 minutes.** Note it is typical for discussions to start _during_ the presentation of, e.g., figures. The moderator is in charge of letting you know when the time to discuss the current paper is up, so be prepared to "wrap up" or show the most important points or plots of the paper at any time. Discussions are dynamic (as they should!).

5. **We abide by the [AAS Code of Ethics](https://aas.org/policies/ethics).**  We are dedicated to providing a harassment-free journal club experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment, abusive behavior, or intimidation of participants in any form. By participating on these sessions, you agree to abide by these statements as well.
