This repository stores the website for the Exocoffee Journal Club at STScI.

## How to edit website content

Editing the website is _extremely_ simple. Simply edit the `index.md` file --- that file contains all the info that's displayed in the website. 
If you are a moderator, simply add papers and presenters in the respective columns --- and that's it! 

## How to update the website 
There are _three_ ways of performing updates on the website. The two preferred ones require you to _fork_ this repository, and then:
1) Make any changes in your fork and submit a pull request to this repository, or...
2) ...ask @nespinoza to be a collaborator, so you can push directly to this repository.

The third way is to just let @nespinoza know the changes you want in the website, and he'll get to it.
